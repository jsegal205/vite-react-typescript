# Jim Segal portfolio site

## Why is this a thing?

I currently have many different repos that some where live around https://jimsegal.com that live in varying repos and varying flavors of javascript and hosted in different places.

- jimsegal.com
  - vanilla js html css
  - hosted on static s3 bucket
- jimsegal projects
  - vanilla js create-react-app
  - hosted on github pages
- jimsegal api
  - vanilla js express
  - hosted on heroku and railway.app
- jimsegal admin
  - vanilla js strapijs
  - hosted on railway.app

This all leads to a lot of complicated flows when I want to add or remove things, it also adds extra cost through the different hosting options.

Another why of this project is I wanted to go deep on TypeScript. I had always been adverse to TypeScript because I liked the dynamic wild west feel of JavaScript. I decided to give a internal talk on TypeScript to get better knowledge surrounding it and it opened my eyes to the benefits of it.
